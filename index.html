    Welcome to my very first HTML project! This page is my starting point in learning how to build websites from scratch.
    <ol>
        <li> HTML is the backbone of every website.</li>
        <li> It helps us organize content, add text, images, and links, and make information easy to read.
        </li>
        <li>I am excited to explore more about web development. In the future, I will learn how to style my page with CSS and add interactivity using JavaScript.</li>
        <li> project is simple, but itâ€™s a big step toward becoming a web developer!</li>
         <li>I am pusring my computer programming diploma in <a href="https://www.saultcollege.ca/">sault college</a>
</li>
